           <h2>General tips:</h2>
           <p> &#8226; Try and stick to a workout split that suits your body</p>
           <p> &#8226; Warm up/stretch properly before exercising to prevent injuries</p>
           <p> &#8226; Start of at a lighter weight, practice the form and then gradually increase the weight (progressive overload)</p>  
           <p> &#8226; Progressive overload - gradually increasing the weight, number of reps or intensity to challenge your muscle to help them develop and grow </p>
           <p> &#8226; Control the weight and develop a mind muscle connection to the chest and this will maximise the growth </p>
           <p> &#8226; Mind muscle connection - directs the attention to the muscle your trying to work on rather than going through the motions</p>

           <h2>Information about shoulders:</h2>
           <p> &#8226; Your shoulders consists of many different muscles - such as front delt, side delt, rear delt and traps</p>
           <p> &#8226; Working out all of the these muscles are really important in order to get 3D shoulders </p>
           <p>&#8226; Getting 3D shoulders really highlights your physique and is key to achieve</p>
