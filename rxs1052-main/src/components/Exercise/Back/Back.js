        <h2>General tips:</h2>
       <p> &#8226; Try and stick to a workout split that suits your body</p>
       <p> &#8226; Warm up/stretch properly before exercising to prevent injuries</p>
       <p> &#8226; Start of at a lighter weight, practice the form and then gradually increase the weight (progressive overload)</p>  
       <p> &#8226; Progressive overload - gradually increasing the weight, number of reps overtime to help increase muscle engagement and development </p>
       <p> &#8226; Lat pulldown's and rows can be done using machines and dumbbells too - form is the same </p>
       <p> &#8226; Make sure elbows are tucked in while performing the movement this prevents joint pains</p>
       <p> &#8226; Control the weight and develop a mind muscle connection to the chest and this will maximise the growth </p>
       <p> &#8226; Mind muscle connection - focusing on the muscle your trying to work rather than no control</p>

    <div className="exercise" id="Deadlift">
        <h2>Deadlift (Barbell)</h2>
        <p>&#8226; Feet should be hip-width apart with your toes pointing forward. Bar should be over the middle of your feet</p>
        <p>&#8226; Grip the bar just outside your legs. Use a overhand grip</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keeping your back straight, make sure your head is in line with your spine</p>
        <p>&#8226; Before you lift, take a deep breath and brace your core - supports your spine - VERY IMPORTANT</p>
        <p>&#8226; Movement should start by pushing your hips back</p>
        <p>&#8226; Lift with your legs and drive with your legs</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep the bar close to your body the entire time</p>
        <p>&#8226; Lower the bar by pushing your hips back first not by bending the knees - once the bar is past your knee, you can bend your legs to return to the floor</p>
        <p>&#8226; Exhale as you pull the bar and inhale when bringing it back down</p>
        <p>Note: Deadlift is a very technical lift and requires understanding the form properly before going heavier - has a lot of benefits if done correctly </p>

    <div className="exercise" id="BentOverRow">
        <h2>Bent Over Rows (Barbell)</h2>
        <p>&#8226; For stability stand shoulder width apart</p>
        <p>&#8226; Start at a low rack position (ideal) or from the ground</p>
        <p>&#8226; Overhand grip - more emphasis on upper back and works lats</p>
        <p>&#8226; Underhand grip - focuses more on lats but uses bicep too</p>
        <p>&#8226; Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width</p>
        <p>&#8226; Slightly bend your knees and use your hips to lean slightly forward</p>
        <p>&#8226; Back alignment - keep a natural spine throughout the movement - avoid rounding your back</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep you neck neutral with your spine </p>
        <p>&#8226; Pull the bar using your arms to your stomach </p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep your elbows close to your body </p>
        <p>&#8226; Lower the bar back down fully extending your arms and repeat</p>
    </div>

    <div className="exercise" id="Lat pulldown">
        <h2>Lat pulldown (cables)</h2>
        <p>&#8226; Adjust the knee pads so that the pad can be against your legs - prevents body from rising</p>
        <p>&#8226; Select a weight - choose a weight that you will be comfortable with </p>
        <p>&#8226; Can use a long bar or a close-grip bar</p>
        <p>&#8226; Grip width - wider grip focuses more on the lats and a narrower grip focuses more on the middle back and lats </p>
        <p>&#8226; Grip type - can use underhand grip and overhand grip - depending on preference </p>
        <p>&#8226; Starting position - sit down and grip the bar with your chosen grip width, with your back straight  </p>
        <p>&#8226; Pull the bar down smoothly to the top of your chest, retracting your shoulder blades and bending your elbows as you pull</p>
        <p>&#8226; Elbows should come down and back towards your side</p>
        <p>&#8226; Contract by squeezing your shoulder blades together at the bottom of the movement </p>
        <p>&#8226; Release the bar slowly back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms </p>
        <p>Tips: Avoid leaning back too much and control the weight </p>
    </div>

    <div className="exercise" id="T-Bar row">
        <h2>T-Bar Row (Barbell)</h2>
        <p>&#8226; Make sure the barbell is positioned correctly before starting</p>
        <p>&#8226; Grip - use a V-grip handle under the bar - grip them firmly with two hands </p>
        <p>&#8226; Stance - shoulder width apart for stability</p>
        <p>&#8226; Bend over at the hips, keeping your back straight </p>
        <p>&#8226; Spine should remain neutral - don't round your back</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep a slight bend with your knees</p>
        <p>&#8226; Pull the top of the plate to your chest and engage your back muscles</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep your elbows close to your body </p>
        <p>&#8226; At the top of the movement squeeze your shoulder blades together </p>
        <p>&#8226; Make sure to control the weight to get the mind muscle connection - better development</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div className="exercise" id="Seated Cable row">
        <h2>Seated Cable Row</h2>
        <p>&#8226; Adjust the seat, bend your knees slightly and your feet flat against the footrests</p>
        <p>&#8226; Choose a weight that your comfortable with and one that allows you to perform the exercise properly with good form </p>
        <p>&#8226; Hold the handle with your palms facing each other. Grip onto the handle firmly</p>
        <p>&#8226; Sit down with your back straight, chest out and shoulders back. Avoid rounding your shoulders </p>
        <p>&#8226; Make sure your elbows are close to your body and pull your shoulder blades together</p>
        <p>&#8226; Pull the handle towards your lower abdomen while not rounding your shoulders</p>
        <p>&#8226; Avoid leaning too much - don't excessive rocking back and forth - too much stress on lower back</p>
        <p>&#8226; Control the weight to feel the back engaging and feel the back working</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep your neck at a neutral position - don't look up or down, look straight</p>
