           <h2>General tips:</h2>
           <p> &#8226; Try and stick to a workout split that suits your body</p>
           <p> &#8226; Warm up/stretch properly before exercising to prevent injuries</p>
           <p> &#8226; Start of at a lighter weight, practice the form and then gradually increase the weight (progressive overload)</p>  
           <p> &#8226; Progressive overload - gradually increasing the weight, number of reps overtime to help increase muscle engagement and development </p>
           <p> &#8226; Bench press and incline bench press can also be carried out using smith machines and normal machines - the form is the same </p>
           <p> &#8226; Make sure elbows are tucked in while performing the movement this prevents joint pains</p>
           <p> &#8226; Control the weight and develop a mind muscle connection to the chest and this will maximise the growth </p>
           <p> &#8226; Mind muscle connection - focusing on the muscle your trying to work rather than no control</p>
