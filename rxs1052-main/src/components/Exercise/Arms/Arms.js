           <h2>General tips:</h2>
           <p> &#8226; Try and stick to a workout split that suits your body</p>
           <p> &#8226; Warm up/stretch properly before exercising to prevent injuries</p>
           <p> &#8226; Start of at a lighter weight, practice the form and then gradually increase the weight (progressive overload)</p>  
           <p> &#8226; Progressive overload - gradually increasing the weight, number of reps or intensity to challenge your muscle to help them develop and grow </p>
           <p> &#8226; Control the weight and develop a mind muscle connection to the chest and this will maximise the growth </p>
           <p> &#8226; Mind muscle connection - directs the attention to the muscle your trying to work on rather than going through the motions</p>

           <h2>Information about arms:</h2>
           <p> &#8226; Your arms have 2 parts - biceps and triceps</p>
           <p> &#8226; Triceps are larger than the bicep as they are made up of three heads - long head, medial head and lateral head </p>
           <p> &#8226; Biceps are made up of two heads - long head and short head - also has brachialis </p>
           <p> &#8226; Getting bigger triceps is the key to get bigger arms but also work on bicep equally</p>

    <div className="exercise" id="tricepPushdown">
        <h2>Tricep - Tricep pushdowns (Cables)</h2>
        <p>&#8226; This exercise works your lateral head</p>
        <p>&#8226; Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent for stability</p>
        <p>&#8226; Keep you back straight and engage your core whilst performing the exercise</p>
        <p>&#8226; Elbows should be at your side and should remain stationary throughout the movement</p>
        <p>&#8226; Push the bar down until your arms are fully extended but not locked - puts stress on the joint</p>
        <p>&#8226; Avoid using momentum to lower the weight - move the attachment down in a controlled manner </p>
        <p>&#8226; Focus on contraction at the bottom of the movement - squeeze your triceps to maximise your progress</p>
        <p>&#8226; Start of light and then gradually increase to make it challenging</p>
        <p>&#8226; IMPORTANT: This exercise can be performed using multiple attachments e.g. rope, v-bar, straight-bar, handle</p>
        <p>&#8226; If using the rope attachment - pull the ends apart at the bottom of the movement to feel an increased contraction</p>

        <p>&#8226; Lower the bar slowly and press powerfully</p>
